# Bradley Mavin – Cybersecurity & IT Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio repository. This is the central hub for my transition from
music/digital technologies teaching into cybersecurity and IT.

I use this repo to:

- Showcase key hands-on projects
- Link to dedicated project repositories
- Track certifications and structured learning
- Provide a single URL I can give to recruiters and hiring managers

## Key Cybersecurity Projects

These are the projects I want employers to see first. Each has its own repository
with code, documentation, and screenshots.

- **SQL Attack & Defend Lab – PHP/MySQL**
  - *Status:* In progress

    Ubuntu hack lab server. Demonstrates SQL injection (login bypass) and will include
    a hardened version using prepared statements and least-privilege DB accounts.
  - *Repo:* [Mavin-db/sql-attack-defend-lab](https://github.com/Mavin-db/sql-attack-defend-lab)

- **Bash File Monitoring Scripts**
  - *Repo:* [Mavin-db/FileMonitoring](https://github.com/Mavin-db/FileMonitoring)
  - *Description:* Bash scripts for file creation, modification, and directory watching.
    Good example of shell scripting, automation, and logging.

- **Bash Scripting Course**
  - *Repo:* [Mavin-db/Bash-Scripting-Course](https://github.com/Mavin-db/Bash-Scripting-Course)
  - *Description:* A structured Bash scripting course progressing from beginner concepts to
    a complete text-based adventure game. Includes seven lessons, documented examples,
    and a final integrated project demonstrating loops, conditionals, arrays, functions,
    and state management. Designed for teaching, self-study, and showcasing scripting proficiency.

## How to Use This Portfolio

If you're a recruiter or hiring manager:

- Start with the **Projects** section above and click through to any repos
  that look relevant.
- Read the docs inside each project repo – I aim to document each lab like a
  mini pentest or engineering task.
